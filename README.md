Fhenix L2 Access Control with FHE

Fhenix L2: A Layer 2 solution optimized for secure and private computations.

Role of FHE: Fully Homomorphic Encryption enables operations on encrypted data without decrypting it. This ensures:
Whitelist verification (addresses or tokens) without exposing sensitive details.
Secure evaluation of compliance checks or business rules on-chain.
Benefits of Using Fhenix L2 with FHE for Access Control:
Privacy Preservation:
User or token verification can occur without exposing underlying data, reducing risks associated with data breaches.
Regulatory Alignment:
Sensitive regulatory checks (e.g., identity or residency verification) are performed in compliance with privacy laws.
Interoperability:
Cross-chain support allows seamless integration with other DeFi platforms.
Smart Contract Workflow
User/Tokens Whitelisting:

A smart contract on Fhenix L2 maintains an encrypted whitelist of addresses and tokens.
Updates to the whitelist are performed securely via encrypted transactions.
Access Validation:

When a user interacts with the pool, the smart contract checks if the user or token is whitelisted.
This verification process leverages FHE to ensure no plaintext data is revealed during validation.
Transaction Approval:

If validation passes, the transaction is processed.
If validation fails, the transaction is rejected without exposing sensitive details.
